Portfolio as an API, Data is scraped from github/stackoverflow. At some point it should save to a DB some where rather than scrape each time.

# Endpoint
`GET api.maxmckenzie.uk`

# Todo
- add super test tests https://www.npmjs.com/package/supertest
- save scraped data to file/DB and scrape on cron job
